Ok I have got an idea regarding pathing that handles critters with different
sizes and different goals etc.
Basically we create the full djikstra maps for finding the player and whatever
else we wanna do it for, and then to apply a given pathing map for a given
critter of a certain size we can use a mask which is generated once for each
area (when asked for, it can be cached). And yeah so levels will have a fixed
size, but it will be bigger than the default terminal window size so scrolling
will be a thing we do.

No wait, that doesn't work because the pathing map changes because things move
around. Maybe we should just A* instead. If we want a dude to path to just being
on the same axis as the player so they can shoot them then we can just change
the heuristic from being distance from the player to being lowest of 1 axis
distances from the player.
